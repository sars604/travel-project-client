## User Stories
* As a signed in user I would like to be able to create a log of all of the places in the world that I have visited.
* As a signed in user I would like to be able to see all of the places that I have been to.
* As a signed in user I would like to be able to edit the info about the place that I have logged. I would also like to be able to “favorite” a place, so that I can see the best places I have been.
* As a signed in user I would like to be able to delete a place that I have logged.

## Planning and Development Stage:
"Where in the World" is an application where users can log cities and countries that they have visited - so they can see how extensively they have travelled the world! I have been lucky enough to be able to travel to a lot of different countries, and I wanted to be able to log those, and I thought other people could use this application to do the same.

The development process to make a functional application to log, edit, read and delete places was actually somewhat simple. So, I spent most of my development time trying to implement the use of Google Maps, so that you can add markers to the map of the places you have visited. Sadly, I was unable to add the map functionality to version 1 of "Where in the World" - but that is in my future plans for this application.


## Unsolved Problems/Future Plans:

The main unsolved issue of my application is the integration with Google Maps. I think the functionality of adding markers to a map of the places you have been is key for an app that is logging this information.

## Preparation

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
2.  Create a new branch, `development`, for your work.
3.  Checkout to the `development` branch.
4.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.
5.  Run `npm run start` to run application on local server.
6. Have fun making it your own!
